Computational Actuarial Science with R 

This repository hosts my personal projects of programming exercises from Computational Actuarial Science with R by Arther Charpentier, CRC press (2015). I included my version of R codes if I could improve the excerpted codes, also corresponding python scripts that I wrote for practice. I also published the HTML version of some of R markdown on RPub (http://rpubs.com/JennyStat).
