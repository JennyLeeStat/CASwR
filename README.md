Computational Actuarial Science with R 

This repository hosts my personal projects of programming exercises from Computational Actuarial Science with R by Arther Charpentier, CRC press (2015). I included my version of R codes if I could improve the excerted codes, also corresponding python scripts that I did for practice.
