Loading libraries to be used in the analysis.

library(caret)
library(tidyverse)

## The dataset preparation

```{r data}
credit <- data(GermanCredit)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
